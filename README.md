# Cold Crypto shop example
An example frontend app with Cold Crypto integration.  
Simulates a caf√©-like environment where the customer makes an order and can then pay for their food using Cold Crypto.  
In a real world scenario this frontend should be tied to a store backend.

Prerequisites:
- Node.js
- Yarn
- [Cold Crypto web](http://github.com/DucaturFw/cold-crypto-web) running on the same machine on port `4444` (can be changed in source code)

Installation:
```
yarn
yarn start
```
Open `http://<host ip>:8080/` on your mobile device to test.
